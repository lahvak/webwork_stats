### Health coverage, frequencies

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual telephone survey 
designed to identify risk factors in the adult population and report emerging 
health trends. The following table summarizes two variables for the respondents: 
health status and health coverage, which describes whether each respondent had 
health insurance.
