### City council survey

A city council has requested a 
household survey be conducted in a suburban area of their city. The area is broken 
into many distinct and unique neighborhoods, some including large homes, some with 
only apartments, and others a diverse mixture of housing structures. Identify the 
sampling methods described below, and comment on whether or not you think they 
would be effective in this setting.

* *Randomly sample 50 households from the city.*

    This is an example of [_]{$popup_srs}.

    This [_]{$popup1} an effective sampling method in this situation.

* *Divide the city into neighborhoods, and sample 20 households from each neighborhood.*

    This is an example of [_]{$popup_strat}.

    This [_]{$popup2} an effective sampling method in this situation.

* *Divide the city into neighborhoods, randomly sample 10 neighborhoods, and sample all households from those neighborhoods.*

    This is an example of [_]{$popup_clus}.

    This [_]{$popup3} an effective sampling method in this situation.

* *Divide the city into neighborhoods, randomly sample 10 neighborhoods, and then randomly sample 20 households from those neighborhoods.*

    This is an example of [_]{$popup_multi}.

    This [_]{$popup4} an effective sampling method in this situation.

* *Sample the 200 households closest to the city council offices.*

    This is an example of [_]{$popup_conv}.

    This [_]{$popup5} an effective sampling method in this situation.
