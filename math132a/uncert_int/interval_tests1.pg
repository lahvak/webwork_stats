BEGIN_PGML
Researchers constructed a [$L]% uncertainty interval estimating the population
proportion of spotted corn weevils that have red eyes.  Their conclusion was:

>>"We are [$L]% confident that the interval between [$lower] and [$upper]
contains the true population proportion of red-eyed spotted corn weevils."<<

* Find the interval's margin of error: [________]{$E}

* Find the sample proportion [` \hat p = `] [__________]{$phat}

* Suppose you want to use the researchers' data to test the null hypothesis [` H_0: p = [$nonreject] `] 
  with [` H_A: p \neq [$nonreject] `] at [$alpha] significance level.  What would be the result of the test?
  [_]{$nonrejectradio}

* Suppose you want to use the researchers' data to test the null hypothesis [` H_0: p = [$reject] `] 
  with [` H_A: p \neq [$reject] `] at [$alpha] significance level.  What would be the result of the test?

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
* The margin of error is exactly half of the length of the interval:

  [`` \frac{[$upper] - [$lower]}{2} = [$E] ``]

* The point estimate [` \hat p `] is exactly in the middle of the interval:

  [`` \frac{[$upper] + [$lower]}{2} = [$phat] ``]

* Since [$nonreject] is clearly _inside_ of the interval, it is a plausible
  value of [` p `], and the null hypothesis _cannot_ be rejected.

* Since [$reject] is clearly _outside_ of the interval, it is not a plausible
  value of [` p `], and the null hypothesis _will_ be rejected.
