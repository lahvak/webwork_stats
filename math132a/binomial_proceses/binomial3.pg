A student rolls a die 20 times.

Is this an example of a *binomial process*?  [_______]{$isBin}

BEGIN_PGML
You are correct, a student rolling a die 20 times is not a binomial process.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
This is not a binomial process for the following reasons:

- There are more than two possible outcomes.
- The success and failure are not well defined.

The description does not tell us what is considered success and what failure.
There are 6 possible outcomes, and we do not know which of them (or what
combination of them) is considered success.

The correct answer is: [$reasons->correct_ans()]
