BEGIN_PGML

**Answer questions about the following scenario:**

Scientists were trying to determine whether modifying certain
letter in the genetic sequence of mice lowers their immunity to
certain virus. It is known that in non-modified population,
[$popperc]% of mice are immune. They collected a sample of 100
modified mice, and counted the number of mice immune to the
virus. There were [$samp] of them.

What type of test was this?

[@ $test->menu() @]*

The null hypothesis is [@ $symb->menu() @]* [@ $ineq->menu() @]* [________]

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

* The test is [$test1->correct_ans()].

  The null hypothesis is [$hyp1->correct_ans()].

* The test is [$test2->correct_ans()].

  The null hypothesis is [$hyp2->correct_ans()].

* The test is [$test3->correct_ans()].

  The null hypothesis is [$hyp3->correct_ans()].
