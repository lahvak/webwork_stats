BEGIN_PGML
In a test for a single proprtion, the null hypothesis is [` H_0: p = [$p] `], 
with alternative hypothesis [` H_A: p \neq [$p] `].  

A simple random sample of size [$n] was collected, with the sample proportion [`\hat{p} = [$phat]`].

We can assume that the sample size is large enough so that a continuity
correction is not needed, and the success-failure condition is satisfied.

According to the Central Limit Theorem for sample proportions, which
distribution can we use to approximate the sampling distribution of
[`\hat{p}`]?

[@ $radiodist->buttons() @]*

To approximate the p-value, we need to:

[@ $radioside->buttons() @]*

END_PGML

install_problem_grader(~~&std_problem_grader);

ANS( $radiodist->cmp() );

ANS( $radioside->cmp() );

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Since we are assuming that the null hypothesis is true, all calculations will be done with [: p = [$p] :].
The CLT says that the sampling distribution of the sample proportions is approximately normal with mean [:p:]
    and standard deviation equal to the _standard error_

[`` SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{[$p]\cdot(1 - [$p])}{[$n]}} = [$SE1] ``]

So the answer for the first part is [$radiodist->correct_ans()].

Since this is a two-tailed test and [` \hat{p} < p `], we need to find the area to the _left_ of [` \hat{p} `] and double it.

So the answer for the second part is [$radioside->correct_ans()].
