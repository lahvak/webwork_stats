BEGIN_PGML

**Answer questions about the following scenario:**

Scientists wanted to know whether proximity to *ribes nigrum*
increases the chance of white pine trees being infected by
blistering pine rust (*cronartium ribicola*). They selected 50
healthy wine pine trees growing in a proximity of *ribes nigrum*
plants, and 50 healthy white pine trees that had no ribes plants
growing within 1 mile radius. They monitored the trees for 5
years and counted how many of them developed symptoms of
blistering rust infection.

What type of study was this?

[__]{$study}

What type of test was this?

[__]{$test}

The null hypothesis is [__]{$symb} [__]{$ineq} [________]{$pop0}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

This was a [$study->correct_ans()].

This is an example of [$test->correct_ans()] test.

The null hypothesis is "[$symb->correct_ans()] [$ineq->correct_ans()] [$pop0]".
