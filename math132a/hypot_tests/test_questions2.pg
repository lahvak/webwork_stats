BEGIN_PGML

**Answer questions about the following scenario:**

Researchers were comparing five different treatments for a virus
causing decrease in leaf size in pear trees. They selected a
sample of 1000 infected trees, and applied each treatment to 200
of them. For each group they measured the average leaf size two
weeks after the application of the treatment. They wanted to see if
some of these treatments worked better.

What type of test was this?

[__]{$test}

The null hypothesis is [__]{$null}

The alternative hypothesis is [__]{$alt}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

This is an example of an [$test->correct_ans()] test.

The null hypothesis is "[$null->correct_ans()]".

The alternative hypothesis is "[$alt->correct_ans()]".

COMMENT("This question includes ANOVA as one of the options.");
