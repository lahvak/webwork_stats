q{Some people claim that they can tell the difference between a diet soda and
a regular soda in the first sip. A researcher wanting to test this claim randomly sampled 80 such
people. He then filled 80 plain white cups with soda, half diet and half regular through random
assignment, and asked each person to take one sip from their cup and identify the soda as diet or
regular. 53 participants correctly identified the soda.},
q{According to a report on sleep deprivation by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, the proportion of California residents who reported
insufficient rest or sleep during each of the preceding 30 days is 8.0%, while
this proportion is 8.8% for Oregon residents. These data are based on simple
random samples of 11,545 California and 4,691 Oregon residents.
Researchers want to know if there is a difference between the proportions of
residents who reported insufficient sleep in the two states.},
q{McDonald (1989) examined variation at the [`Mpi`] locus in the amphipod
crustacean _Platorchestia platensis_ collected from a single location on Long
Island, New York. There were two alleles, [`Mpi^{90}`] and [`Mpi^{100}`] and the genotype
frequencies in samples from multiple dates pooled together were 1203 [`Mpi^{90/90}`],
2919 [`Mpi^{90/100}`], and 1678 [`Mpi^{100/100}`]. 
According to the Hardy-Weinberg formula, the expected genotype proportions are
0.211 [`Mpi^{90/90}`], 0.497 [`Mpi^{90/100}`], and 0.293 [`Mpi^{100/100}`]. Do the data fit the 
expected Hardy-Weinberg proportions?},
q{The FDAâ€™s webpage provides some data on mercury content of fish. Based on a sample of 15 croaker 
white fish (Pacific), a sample mean and standard deviation were computed as 0.287 and 0.069 ppm 
(parts per million), respectively. The EPA maximum recommended mercury contents in fish is 0.3 ppm. 
Do the data provide sufficient evidence that the mean mercury contents of Pacific croaker white fish
is below the EPA recommended maximum?},
q{Researchers selected a sample of 100 volunteers and recorded the palm width
of their dominant and non-dominant hand.  They wanted to see is dominant hands are generally 
larger than non-dominant hands.},
q{Researchers selected a sample of 40 right-handed and 30 left-handed volunteers.  For each volunteer, 
they measured the palm width of their dominant hand.  They wanted to see if the mean palm width
of the dominant hand is the same for left-handed and right-handed people.},
q{Participants in a study investigating the
relationship between coffee consumption and exercise were asked to report 
their coffee consumption level (none: less than one cup a week, light: 2 to 6
cups a week, medium: 1 cup a day, serious: 2 to 3 cups a day, and heavy: 4 or more cups a day),
and the number of hours they spent per week on moderate (e.g., brisk walking) and
vigorous (e.g., strenuous sports and jogging) exercise. Based on the exercise data the
researchers estimated the total hours of metabolic equivalent tasks (MET) per
week, a numerical value always greater than 0.
The researchers wanted to know if the average physical activity level varies among the
different levels of coffee consumption.}
